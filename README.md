# Mobile-Subscribers-Churn-Prediction
Before we start, it is important mention that the project not only covers the process of Retrieving the data, Manipulating it, and Ingesting it into the Machine Learning Model, but also some additional steps with statistical methods, such as Handling Imbalanced Data, as well as Visualizations to effectively predict whether a subscriber will become "silent" or not.

 

For this specific dataset, the churn column represents customers who have become "silent," meaning that they have no activity within the company's mobile network, no data, text messages, or calls. This condition is maintained for a period of time until the line can be canceled and reused.

 

NumPy and Pandas will be used for the data manipulation part, Matplotlib and Seaborn for the visualizations, and Scikit-Learn to develop the machine learning model; all within a Jupyter notebook.
